* Social media strategy
    * how are we going to keep in contact with the community and the community with us?
       1. a person or circle who'd be caring for that (nobody willing to do that at the moment... let's not loose connection with the community!)
       2. have a rotation to answer to the questions
       3. let it remain unanswered, maybe the community will take care to some extent
       4. Contributors Open Hours
