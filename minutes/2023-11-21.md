#### Proposed agenda points

- [info, michal] there will be meeting with funding organizers on 20.11.2023 at 16-18 CET (on Monday), let's join with questions

- [exploration + decision, michal] How long to apply for? (3, 6, 9 months)
    - 3 or 9 months, because of summer break
- [exploration + decision, michal] How much? (up to 50k, 75k, 100k EUR)
    - how would we use funds? => estimate - amount of people
    - half time job commitment
        - 39w * 20h/w * 40e = 31 200e 
    - another method: our roadmap and time that it takes per item
- [exploration, michal] Legal entity
    - who?
        - michal, mariha, Ola?
        - do we close ourselves for this time, or is there space for people to join in the meantime? what then?
    - Stowarzyszenie? Or different?
        - [mariha, or Ola] - is "Stowarzyszenie" fitting to our purpose?
        - [michal (maybe)] research of alternatives, maybe, outside of Poland, etc... (be aware of language!)
- [exploration, michal] How do we get US/Canada partner? It should be organization. They must write the letter of support, and we need to submit plans for collaboration. They aren't allowed to benefit financially from this funding.
    - Solid
        - [michal] will prepare message to ask
    - NGI Sargasso partnership hub
    - David, Jesse, Jason
        - [mariha] will write to Jesse
    - WarmShowers
- [exploration, michal] Plans to write the application
- we'll need to do accounting

- [] let's make sure that (at least) the relevant people join the [sleepy.bike/funding](https://matrix.to/#/#sleepy.bike-funding:matrix.org) matrix channel so we can plan asynchronously

- Objective criteria of organization?
