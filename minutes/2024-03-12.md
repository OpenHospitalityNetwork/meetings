#### Agenda

* [mariha] Hackathon - questions to answer for Jeff (for 1.04.24)
    * we can create our non-competitive hackathon. The next step is for any project that wants to have a hackathon dedicated to their project, to draw up a proposal - what would the goals and tools be? What Solid issues would be addressed? What technical problems would need to be solved? Who would lead/mentor? Who would judge if we decide to have judges?
    * [michal] nice that it can be less competitive. I still have concern about the overhead of managing it, that wasn't addressed, and generally speaking, I'm not up to managing, reviewing, judging, etc.
    * [michal] maybe there is opportunity to have topic of (geo)indexing that Mariha could manage?

* [michal] Process
    * The requirement for code reviews on sleepy.bike repo makes the progress slower and more frustrating. Currently I have piling PRs depending on each other. I think it doesn't make sense to require code reviews as long as there are 1-2 authors. Can we either pause it (for me :wink: or for owners) until there are more people, or give a limited time for a review, after which merge without review is allowed?
