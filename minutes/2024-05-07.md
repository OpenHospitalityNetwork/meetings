### 2024.05.07

* who: Michal

* stats:  151 members (+5), hosts 37 (+0)

#### Agenda

* nobody present, self-meeting, thoughts about what to do

* Mariha's departure from sleepy.bike, and next steps to ensure project continuity
    * Mariha should pass domain name, and other sleepy.bike assets she controls to one of the remaining (somewhat active) members (Chagai or Michal)
    * move sleepy.bike repositories to a separate GitHub organization, so there isn't membership conflict between OHN and sleepy.bike
    * other members and owners in the repo should be invited to join with the same status within the new org
    * make OHN and sleepy.bike matrix spaces independent

(update 2024-05-21: Mariha later clarified that she had only left Matrix room, so the assumption for the above was incorrect)

* conflict resolution
    * not successful
