##### To come

* Make people aware that sleepy.bike exists - other channals of communication: FB group, list of emails from the WS survey, mastodon, ohn website ;), pps who registered with earlier version of sleepy.bike

* stats how many members / hosts there are
    * 17 members, 10 hosts

* we need to make better job at explaining _what_ is Solid and _why_ we chose it,
    * what benefits it brings, with added complexity?
    * How it prevents similar situation that happend to WS to happen again?
    * _"Sign up and be part of the future of the internet!"_
    * Quote from the [Tim Berners-Lee letter "One Small Step for the Web…"](https://www.inrupt.com/blog/one-small-step-for-the-web) on Oct 22, 2018
      > _Solid changes the current model where users have to hand over personal data to digital giants in exchange for perceived value. As we’ve all discovered, this hasn’t been in our best interests. Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance - by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way._

    * recommended setup? 
        * own your WebId + replicate data between two Pod providers (primary and a backup), possibly one self-hosted on your own computer

* discussion: Why we chose Solid? What we find essential in Solid?
    1. You can own your identity on the web
    2. There is no monopoly of identity providers
    3. There is a standard data format for hospitality exchange apps that many applications can share / understand
    (4. some of the vocabulary / ontologies how the data is written can be understandable by wider semantic web) 
    5. Users own their data and can:
        - revoke access to it if they don't want to share it any more
        - keep them whoever administers/moderates the community
