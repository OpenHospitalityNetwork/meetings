    >    - how to make people know about what we do, make them interested, build and nurture a community (sleepy bike or other)
    >    - connections to existing hospitality exchange networks
    >    - looking at sleepy bike, UX, design, feedback
    >    - coding sleepy bike
    >    - other tech & protocols of OHN
    >    ...
    > i may have omitted something important
