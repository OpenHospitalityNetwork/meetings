Open Hospitality Network meeting
===============================
 
[This](https://pad.kanthaus.online/ohn) is a space to _meet, share ideas and concerns, discuss and plan for the future_ in **real time** with other **human beings** without technical overhead of writing and reading.

_Updates_ can also be shared elsewhere ([repo](https://github.com/OpenHospitalityNetwork), [board](https://trello.com/b/snYAVXym), [chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#hospex:matrix.org)), asynchronously. 

_Recurring_ so that we donâ€™t have to coordinate each time we want to discuss _something_.
